Hello everyone,
This is the first project of The Odin Project I will be working on.
We have so far learned about how the internet works.
What technologies combine together to build a website.
What are different types of web developers.

We have also learned a few things about HTML language which is a structural language.

HTML helps in creating a structure of website.

We have learned about headings, paragraphs, links, images and few more things.

Now its time to put all those learnings to test by creating a webpage.

This repository contains all the files that are needed to create that webpage.

This is my first official project. 

Hope you like it :)
